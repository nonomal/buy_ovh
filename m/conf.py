"""Typed configuration objects.

Before this module the four entry-point scripts carried a MAIN_DEFAULTS
dict and a loadConfigMain helper that mutated globals(). That pattern
made adding a new flag a multi-place edit and made refetch impossible to
unit-test without monkey-patching a module.

Two dataclasses cover the current scripts:

- BuyOvhConfig: everything buy_ovh / the interactive UI reads, plus the
  few flags the UI mutates at runtime (show*, fakeBuy, addVAT,
  months). conf.yaml is the single source of truth — toggles made in
  the UI live for the session only and are never persisted.
- MonitorConfig: what monitor_ovh's loop reads, including the email and
  autoBuy blocks. No UI state.

Both are plain mutable dataclasses: the UI mutates the buy_ovh instance
directly, and monitor_ovh mutates autoBuy rules in place across cycles.
