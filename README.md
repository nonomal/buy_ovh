# buy_ovh
Three little Python scripts wrapped around the OVH API and their Python helper. See here: https://github.com/ovh/python-ovh

Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There is a conf file that you need to make, conf.yaml, where you can define stuff. There is an example file provided. The file explains all the parameters. You can keep one conf.yaml for all three scripts or split it — each script ignores the keys it doesn't use.

In there you at least need the following for the connection to the API: endpoint, api key and secret. You can read about them at the python-ovh repo (above). A consumer key is also needed but buy_ovh will help you generate one if you have not got one.

It's recommended to have at least a filter on the server name (or plan code) otherwise the list will be huge.

## buy_ovh
The interactive one. It fetches the catalog at startup and drops you in a navigator — everything happens from there, there is no separate command prompt.

Invocation:
```
python buy_ovh.py [--conf PATH]              # interactive (default)
python buy_ovh.py [--conf PATH] list         # print the list and exit
python buy_ovh.py [--conf PATH] buy !3 ?5x2  # run a buy grammar and exit
```
`--conf` (or `-c`) points at the YAML config file (default `./conf.yaml`). `buy` tokens are `!N` / `?N` (buy now / invoice for row N) with an optional multiplier `xM` or `*M`. Indices are the `#` column from `list`.

`list` caches the printed rows at `~/.buy_ovh/last_list.json` with a timestamp, and `buy` reads that cache instead of refetching — so indices line up with whatever `list` last showed you. If you haven't run `list` yet, `buy` refuses and tells you to.

Interactive toggles (shown columns, VAT, fake-buy, months, include-unavailable, include-unknown, sort) apply for the current session only — `conf.yaml` is the single source of truth and the toggles reset to its values on the next run. Set the defaults you want in `conf.yaml`; the `R` key reloads it to reset your live session.

Interactive keys:

- `↑`/`↓` (or `j`/`k`) move the cursor; `PgUp`/`PgDn`, `g`/`G` for jumps.
- `!` buys the highlighted row, `?` requests an invoice for it. To create several orders at once, type a number first (vim style): `3!` places three identical orders.
- `:` opens a buy-command line inside the navigator — same grammar as the `buy` subcommand (`!3 ?5x2 !10*3`), Enter runs it, Esc cancels, Ctrl-U clears.
- `/` opens filter mode. The focus jumps to the filter row under the column headers; `←`/`→` (or `Tab`) moves between columns, typing edits the regex, `Enter` applies, `Esc` cancels, `Ctrl-U` clears the current cell. Numeric columns (price, fee, total) accept `<N`, `>N`, `<=N`, `>=N`, `=N`, or a bare number (treated as `<=N`). `X` clears every filter at once. The `filterName` / `filterDisk` / `filterMemory` / `maxPrice` keys in `conf.yaml` are a separate layer applied at catalog-fetch time and do not show up in the filter bar.
- `s` opens sort mode: `←`/`→` (or `Tab`) pick the column to sort by and the list re-sorts as you move, `Space` flips between ascending (`▲`) and descending (`▼`), `x` goes back to the catalog order, `Enter` keeps the sort, `Esc` restores the previous one. The sorted column's header carries the arrow. In the navigator, `S` reverses the current sort without opening sort mode. Prices sort on their real value and text columns sort naturally, so `8g` comes before `32g`. Set `sortKey` / `sortReverse` in `conf.yaml` for a default (e.g. always cheapest first).
- `M` cycles the commitment term 1 → 12 → 24 months, `T` toggles VAT, `r` refreshes the catalog, `R` reloads `conf.yaml` from disk.
- `c`/`f`/`b`/`u`/`U`/`$` toggle CPU / FQN / BW columns, include-unavailable, include-unknown-availability and fake-buy mode.
- `h` opens the in-app key reference, `q` or `Esc` quits.

The colour coding is in the code. Red is unavailable. Green and yellow are available. Etc.

If you end up buying a 600€ server, it's not the script fault, it's yours, because this is just a random python script you found on the internet.

All three scripts accept `--conf PATH` (or `-c PATH`) to point at a config file other than `./conf.yaml`.

## monitor_ovh
The headless one. Runs forever, refreshing availability and the catalog every `sleepsecs`, and can email you when servers appear or disappear or when their availability changes. It can also auto-buy servers that match an `auto_buy` rule. Credentials are only required if `auto_buy` is set — for plain monitoring, the public endpoints are enough. Run it in tmux or as a systemd service.

## manage_ovh
A small TUI to browse your servers and your orders (unpaid or undelivered). Press Enter on an order to open its URL in your browser.

I have only tested with OVH France.
